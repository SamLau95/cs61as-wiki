Theta notation relates the running-time of a function to the size of its arguments by providing both a lower and an upper bound on how the running time will increase given large inputs. We say a function $f(n) = \theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n)$ is always less than than or equal to $g(n)$ multiplied by some constant for large values of $n$.
