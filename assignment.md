In computer science, an assignment statement binds a particular [value](wiki:value) to a computer [variable](wiki:variable). Scheme uses the primitive `define` for assignment statements.

    (define a 1)                ;; Assigns the value 1 to `a`
    (define (square x) (* x x)) ;; Assigns the procedure to `square`
