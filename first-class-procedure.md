[Procedures](wiki:procedure) are said to be first-class if they can be passed around as data like integers or lists in Scheme.  Specifically, first-class procedures can take other procedures as [arguments](wiki:argument), can be returned by other procedures, and can be assigned to [variables](wiki:variable). All procedures in [Scheme](wiki:scheme) are first class, a key distinction from some other languages that allows for [higher-order procedures](wiki:higher-order-procedure).
