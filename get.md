`get` is a [procedure](wiki:procedure) used to retrieve information from a table. The number of [arguments](wiki:argument) you supply to it is equal to the dimensionality of the table. If there is no entry for the particular keys, then `get` returns `#f`.

To see how to put entries in your table, see [`put`](wiki:put).
