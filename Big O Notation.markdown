In mathematics, big O notation describes the behavior of a function when its argument tends towards infinity, usually in terms of simpler functions.

For example, when $n$ becomes large, the function $2n^2 + n - 3$ is dominated by the $n^2$ term, so it is $O(n^2)$.

Big O notation is frequently used to analyze the running time of programs.  To see an example, go to [Orders of Growth](../orders-growth/).
